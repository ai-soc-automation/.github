## 📍 About the Organization

**AI-SOC-Automation** is an open research and development initiative focused on designing intelligent agents for Security Operations Centers (SOCs) using Large Language Models (LLMs), data-centric pipelines, and automation tools.

We aim to:
- Reduce **MTTR** through intelligent alert triage and prioritization
- Enrich security logs contextually using LLM-powered pipelines
- Support researchers and analysts with reproducible datasets and tools
- Document the transition from manual SOC workflows to AI-native systems
